      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <button class="accordion">
        <h3>Does height really matter in the gym?</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Yes, it does!</strong> To be as brief as possible, usually the
          taller you are the more time it will take you to build muscles. A rare
          win for all the short kings out there.<br />
          But let's get into the details now: There is actually no significant
          effect that height has on muscle growth. What actually makes it look
          like so is that the shorter you are, the less muscle volume you'll
          need to fill (for example; taller limbs = more muscle).<br />
          Moreover, the shorter you are, the more height-to-width ratio you'll
          have, which explains why 2 equally wide people with different heights
          seem to have the shorter one more buff and muscular.<br />
          So to keep things short, no pun intended, the appearance and the time
          it takes for results to show may vary according to your height. Yet
          muscle growth does not depend on it.

        <h3>Does diet play a role in bodybuilding?</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <strong
            >Nutrition is actually the biggest factor in your bodybuilding
            progress!</strong
          >
          You should know that you're better off skipping weightlifting if
          you're not eating good food, whether you're cutting(losing weight) or
          bulking(gaining weight).<br />
          This is primarly because of the fact that your body requires all
          macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients
          (vitamins and minerals) for it to function normally, let alone the
          intensive activities and the muscle growth.<br />
          For example, having a deficit in protein will cause your muscles to be
          at risk for way more injuries, need more time to recover from soreness
          and inflammation, and also stay at its same mass/size if not lose
          some.

            >Learn more about protein deficiency's results.</a
          ><br />
          And protein is only one example of the many problems having an
          unbalanced diet causes... Which is why we recommend you do research
          about what you should eat and how much!
          <a href="yobro">Keep reading about nutrition in the gym.</a>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <strong>By stopping asking that question!</strong> Seriously, getting
          stuck in the rabbithole of reading a thousand gym article about which
          plan, which diet and which pace you should take is unnecessary.<br />
          Many people find all the details in their first steps to be exhausting
          and deterring while many experienced bodybuilders do not regret
          starting blindely and fixing themselves as time passes..<br />
          All you need to know is the basics of eating good, training hard and
          resting enough. While you get more experienced and research on how to
          get better, you will reach your goal faster than the guy who's
          overloading his brain with each intricate point.

      <button class="accordion"><h3>How to not lose motivation?</h3></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <strong
            >To be honest with you, you most definitely will lose your
            motivation at some point..</strong
          >
          Even with your hundreds of motivational instagram reels, all your
          gymbros, all your hardstyle and brazilian phonk music.<br />
          Because what you need is discipline; motivation is your first step of
          the journey, discipline is what builds the consistency you require to
          keep moving.<br />
          You must teach yourself to sacrifice your comfort zone in order to
          achieve a goal you wish for.

      <button class="accordion"><h3>What impact does age have?</h3></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <strong>Generally, yes...</strong> Muscle growth slows down the more
          you age, alongside the strength.<br />
          But so do your nutrinional needs: Since the body isn't growing as much
          as before, you may be able to reduce your food intake. You shouldn't
          be too bothered though, as this is for 30 and above usually!
